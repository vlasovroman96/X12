 * @brief seatd_libseat_open_graphics returns opened fd via rpc call through seatd
 * @param path node path
 * @warning this function returns <0 in case of error (for example -2)
 * @return file descriptior or <0
 *
 * @warning _X_EXPORT is only for internal consuption (currently for modesetting only, because its `open_hw` function calls open directly)
 *
 * @note XXX: maybe in future Xlibre public api could gain function for opening device nodes by path?
