/**
 * \file
 *
 * Defines the interface between the libglvnd server module and a vendor
 * library.
 *
 * Each screen may have one vendor library assigned to it. The GLVND module
 * will examine each GLX request to determine which screen it goes to, and then
 * it will forward that request to whichever vendor is assigned to that screen.
 *
 * Each vendor library is represented by an opaque __GLXServerVendor handle.
 * Display drivers are responsible for creating handles for its GLX
 * implementations, and assigning those handles to each screen.
 *
 * The GLVND module keeps a list of callbacks, which are called from
 * InitExtensions. Drivers should use that callback to assign a vendor
 * handle to whichever screens they support.
 *
 * Additional notes about dispatching:
 * - If a request has one or more GLXContextTag values, then the dispatch stub
 *   must ensure that all of the tags belong to the vendor that it forwards the
 *   request to. Otherwise, if a vendor library tries to look up the private
 *   data for the tag, it could get the data from another vendor and crash.
 * - Following from the last point, if a request takes a GLXContextTag value,
 *   then the dispatch stub should use the tag to select a vendor. If the
 *   request takes two or more tags, then the vendor must ensure that they all
 *   map to the same vendor.
